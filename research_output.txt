Hot Dog Preparation Research:

There are several methods to prepare hot dogs:

1. Boiling: Place hot dogs in a pot of water and bring to a boil (4-5 minutes)
2. Grilling: Grill for 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally for even cooking
3. Pan-frying: Cook in a skillet over medium heat for about 5 minutes
4. Microwave: Cook for 30-45 seconds (timing may vary)

Serve in a bun with preferred condiments like mustard, ketchup, relish, or onions.

Safety tip: Ensure hot dogs reach an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C)
